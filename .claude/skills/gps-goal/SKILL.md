description: Revise or replace one existing goal mid-cycle (interactive). Edit a goal's target, milestones, why, if-thens, or operating procedure — logged as a dated scope change; or retire a goal and stand up a replacement in its slot, gated by a drift check. The guarded alternative to waiting for /gps-reset.

# GPS Goal — revise or replace one goal

Interactive — use AskUserQuestion throughout. Tone from `data/config.json`. Read
`CLAUDE.md`, `method/gps-adapted.md`, `data/config.json`, the active goal files in the
current cycle dir, `data/goals/anti-goals.md`, and `data/profile.md` first.

**Two hard rules:** never silently rewrite or delete a goal — every change is dated and
logged in the goal's `## Scope changes`; never exceed 3 active goals.

## Step 1 — pick the goal and the mode

List the active goals; ask which one. Then ask: **revise** (edit this goal in place) or
**replace** (retire it and stand up a new goal in its slot)?

## A — Revise (edit in place)

2. Ask what changes (one or more): metric/target, a milestone (move / edit / add / drop),
   the why, an if-then, the operating procedure, or scope (shrink).
3. Apply the edits to the goal file. Guardrails:
   - **Shrinking the target** → re-score the second 80% check ("will I actually do it")
     against the base rate in `data/profile.md`; record the new score in `## 80% checks`.
   - **Machine test** → if the change alters whether the goal is reached by repeating a
     unit of work, add or remove the `## Operating procedure` accordingly (fill it, or
     delete it — never leave it blank; no unused circuitry).
   - Don't quietly *expand* scope to dodge a hard week — if that's what's happening, name it.
4. **Log** a dated line in `## Scope changes` (what changed, why).

## B — Replace (retire + new)

2. **Friction check first.** Replacing a goal mid-cycle is the shiny-object move the
   system is built to resist — the `no-new-projects` anti-goal applies, and promotion
   normally waits for `/gps-reset`. State this plainly (per config tone) and confirm the
   owner truly wants to replace, rather than **revise** the current goal or **park** the
   new idea. If they hesitate, offer `park this idea: <one line>` and stop.
3. **Close the outgoing goal honestly — never hard-delete.** Score what actually got
   done, set its frontmatter `status:` to `done` / `missed` / `dropped`, harvest one
   lesson into the file, and log the retirement + reason in `## Scope changes`. A
   non-active status frees the slot (keeping active goals ≤ 3).
4. **Stand up the replacement** in the freed slot via `templates/goal-template.md`:
   specific measurable outcome (learning-goal override for novel work), identity why,
   milestones, the two 80% checks, WOOP + ≥3 if-thens covering the profile's obstacle
   classes, and the operating procedure (machine test). Write
   `data/goals/<cycle>/g<N>-<slug>.md`.

## Both paths — close out

5. Update `data/tracking/scorecard.md` (rename/replace the goal's row; keep retired
   goals' closing scores for the record).
6. Refresh the dashboard (`/gps-dashboard`).
7. Confirm to the owner: what changed, where it's logged, and the next action.
